# Tutorial: Machine Learning with QIIME 2

This repository contains materials accompanying the Functional Genomics Center ZÃ¼rich course **Next-Generation Sequencing Applied to Metagenomics (BIO638)**. To jump directly to the analysis notebooks, click on the badges for the corresponding tutorials below.

These notebooks describe simplified analyses of microbiome datasets using the with the bioinformatics platform [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/). To learn more about the QIIME 2 project and applications in microbiome research, visit https://qiime2.org/.
